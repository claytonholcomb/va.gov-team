## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Facilitator name] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is on the call who will be taking notes.

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double check with you before we get going. 

**Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

We've invited you here today to help us improve a website for Veterans. We’ll use our time today to talk about an upcoming transition the VA is making to move My HealtheVet over onto VA.gov.. In a little bit, I'll ask you to share your screen with me. We'll sign into your account together and do a few tasks within the session. 

 Before we jump in with prompts and questions, I first have some information to confirm with you:

#### For screenreader or mobile sessions
- **For screenreader sessions:** I understand you use screenreader software to navigate the internet, what SOFTWARE do you typically use? Are you able to use that during our session today?
      - What is your skill level using that software? Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced?
      - What device do you typically use? Windows PC, Apple, phone?
      - What browser are you using today? Is that what you typically use? 

- **For mobile sessions:** I understand you primarily use your phone to access the internet. Can you confirm that you are on your phone now? 

Thank you for confirming these things! 

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session could take up to 60 minutes**
 - **I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- Any questions I can answer at this point?
- The last thing is about recordings. Because we will be asking you to share your healthcare portal with us today and looking at your real patient data, we will not record any video. We would like to ask if we can record the audio for our session, so that we don't mis-capture anything you. If you agree, we will not link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record our audio as we talk today?**

## <a name="warm-up"></a>Warm-up questions (5 minutes)

1. What experience do you have with VA.gov?
- How often do you login? 
- For what purpose?

3. If does not mention My HealtheVet,
- What about with My HealtheVet? 
- How often do you login? 
- For what purpose?

   
**Note why participants typically log in to VA.gov and MHV - to be used later in the study** 


## <a name="set-up"></a> Set up & sign-in (10 minutes)

Thanks for answering those questions. I want to transition us to exploring the sites together. First I want you to share your screen. Is that something you've done before with Zoom? 

- [Have they shared before?]
  - `IF YES` Please share your screen when you're ready.
  - `IF NO` I’ll help guide you through how to share your screen...

### Troubleshooting: Screen share issues

#### Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, first tap anywhere on the screen, then you should see a row of buttons. In the center is a button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

#### Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate.

> Screen sharing starts.

- Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen. I see [describe window].

- Next, I'm going to ask you to go to the My HealtheVet website.

- Can you show me how you would get to My HealtheVet?

Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:
What are you thinking as you (go somewhere, do something)?
Is that what you would typically do to get to My HealtheVet? 
(If use search functionality): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
(If participant gets stuck and unable to find My HealtheVet) It looks like you're not finding the site. 
 What would you do at this point? (If participant says they would call or use resources outside of VA.gov) 
Great [Chat the participant link to MHV National Portal]

- Okay, now, I'll ask you to sign in on this website. 

- Looks like you are signed in!

- Thank you for going through those tasks and all your insight. I just have a few final questions to ask you. You can stop sharing your screen now if you'd like to.

On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding what you were looking for in that site we just explored together?
    - Why that rating?

- Did you find one version easier than another to use? Why? What about it?
- If you were talking to a friend that is also a Veteran who wanted to use these tools, how would you describe the relationship between this site and the VA.gov?

- Do you have any questions for me?

### If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
